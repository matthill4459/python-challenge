This code will also show the average change in profit, and show the greatest increase and decrease in profit along with its corasponding month.

I did use some code snippets from Chat GPT These snippets are:

    lines 36 - 39, and 56 - 62

I recived help from Chat GPT with the variables and greatest increase and decrease
    
    lines 9-17 and 42-47

## PyPoll
The code for PyPoll will much like the code above will scan though a CSV file. This code however, will scan though a CSV file called election_data. This code will scan though all the election data. it will store the votes, and the candidates who are running. The code will then spit out Total Votes, the top three candidates their vote count and the percentage of votes that went to them respectivly. It will finally print out the winner based on votes.
